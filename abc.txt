The basic technique stands in contrast to hunt and peck typing in which
the typist keeps his or her eyes on the source copy at all times. Touch
typing also involves the use of the home row method, where typists keep
their wrists up, rather than resting them on a desk or keyboard (which
can cause carpal tunnel syndrome). To avoid this, typists should sit up
tall, leaning slightly forward from the waist, place their feet flat on
the floor in front of them with one foot slightly in front of the other,
and keep their elbows close to their sides with forearms slanted slightly
upward to the keyboard; fingers should be curved slightly and rest on the
home row.
